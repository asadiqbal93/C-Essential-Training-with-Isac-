Declaring and using Integer types
• The following code along with its comments will show you how much space all types of integers occupy 
• This helps you decide which type to use when performing a certain task in relation to how much its size is and what range of values it covers
/*
Integer Types
__________________________________________________________________________________________
   Type          |  Size           | Range

   char          |      1 byte     | -128 to 127 or 0 to 255
   unsigned char |      1 byte     | 0 to 255
   signed char   |      1 byte     | -128 to 127
    unsigned int |  2 or 4 bytes   | 0 to 65,535 or 0 to 4,294,967,295
    short        |  2 or 4 bytes   | -32,768 to 32,767
   unsigned short|  2 or 4 bytes   | 0 to 65,535
    long         |  2 or 4 bytes   | -2,147,484,648 to 2,147,483,647
    unsigned long|  2 or 4 bytes   | 0 to 4,294,967,295
