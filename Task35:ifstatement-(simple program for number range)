   Simple if-statement

   -Unless otherwise instructed the code is executed in the order it is written
   -Sometimes a different course of action is needed based on a given condition:
        if(condition)

                doSomething;

                example:

                --If a number is negative , make it positive
                    if(x<0)
                        x =(-1)*x;
