    • Rule of thumb: ask yourself whether the name of a variable
    • , a function , a macro, etc. makes sense to you.
    •
    • Are you going to remember next week or next month or in a year
    • what you meant?
    •
    • If your project needs to be transferred to someone else(so you can get
    • a promotion) will they be able to understand your code? Or perhaps you
    • will stay stuck in your lower level position because you are a prisoner
    • of your code..
